# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Paper Trading System is a comprehensive simulation environment that automatically executes options trades based on signals from the Smart Options Recommendation Engine and ReadySetGo Multi-Ticker Orchestrator. The system provides real-time PnL tracking, performance analytics, and algorithm feedback loops to continuously improve trading strategies without risking actual capital. It integrates seamlessly with the existing Gamma Adaptive Trading System to provide a complete paper trading experience with options contract selection, position management, and learning capabilities.

4. WHEN generating performance reports THEN the system SHALL provide breakdowns by ticker, strategy, and time period
5. WHEN trade patterns are identified THEN the system SHALL highlight best-performing signal types and market conditions
6. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and recommendations for strategy adjustments

### Requirement 5: Algorithm Feedback and Learning System

**User Story:** As a system developer, I want the paper trading results to feed back into the algorithm to improve signal quality and confidence calibration, so that the system continuously learns and adapts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trades are analyzed THEN the system SHALL adjust confidence thresholds based on actual vs expected outcomes
2. WHEN signal effectiveness is measured THEN the system SHALL modify future confidence scores for similar signal patterns
3. WHEN learning insights are generated THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for algorithm improvements
4. WHEN confidence adjustments are made THEN they SHALL be bounded to Â±20% to prevent over-fitting
5. WHEN feedback is provided THEN it SHALL include specific recommendations for entry timing, position sizing, and exit strategies
6. WHEN algorithm performance improves THEN the system SHALL track and report learning progress metrics

### Requirement 6: Integration with Existing Systems

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want seamless integration with the existing Gamma Adaptive Trading System components, so that paper trading works harmoniously with regime detection and multi-ticker orchestration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with RegimeCompass THEN the system SHALL use regime classifications to adjust position sizing and strategy selection
2. WHEN integrating with ReadySetGo Controller THEN the system SHALL listen for trade signals and execute paper trades automatically
3. WHEN integrating with EventBus THEN the system SHALL emit position updates, trade completions, and performance metrics
4. WHEN integrating with existing dashboard THEN paper trading metrics SHALL display alongside live trading components
5. WHEN multi-ticker orchestration is active THEN paper trading SHALL handle concurrent signals from multiple tickers
6. WHEN switching between paper and live trading THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent signal processing and execution logic

### Requirement 7: Paper Trading Dashboard and Visualization

**User Story:** As a trader, I want a comprehensive dashboard that displays paper trading performance, open positions, and analytics, so that I can monitor and analyze my paper trading results effectively.
