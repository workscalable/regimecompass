# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Gamma Adaptive Trading System v3.0 is a complete production trading system with multi-asset orchestration that enhances the existing paper trading system with advanced signal processing, smart options trading, and comprehensive performance analytics. The system provides simultaneous monitoring of 10+ tickers with intelligent state management, automated options recommendations, and machine learning feedback loops. It integrates multiple data sources (Polygon.io, Tradier, CBOE) and provides a comprehensive Next.js dashboard for real-time monitoring and analysis.
