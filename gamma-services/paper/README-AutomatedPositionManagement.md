# Automated Position Management System

## Overview

The Automated Position Management System is a comprehensive solution for managing options positions with intelligent automation based on confidence levels, time constraints, and portfolio risk management. This system implements task 6.3 from the Gamma Adaptive System specification.

## Key Features

### 1. Confidence-Based Exit Management
- **Dynamic Exit Parameters**: Profit targets, stop losses, and time decay thresholds adjust based on signal confidence
- **High Confidence Trades**: Wider stops, higher profit targets, more theta tolerance
- **Low Confidence Trades**: Tighter stops, lower profit targets, less theta tolerance
- **Automatic Calibration**: Exit conditions are set automatically when positions are created

### 2. Time-Based Exit Handling
- **Maximum Holding Period**: Prevents positions from being held too long (default: 72 hours)
- **Expiration Management**: Force exits before expiration to avoid assignment risk
- **Weekend Exits**: Optional weekend position closure for risk management
- **Intrinsic Value Settlement**: Automatic calculation and settlement at expiration

### 3. Portfolio Heat Management
- **Real-time Heat Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of portfolio exposure
- **Graduated Response System**: Heat reduction → Emergency exits based on thresholds
- **Consecutive Loss Protection**: Automatic position size reduction after losses
- **Drawdown Protection**: Defensive mode activation during drawdowns

### 4. Position Size Validation
- **Risk-Based Sizing**: Maximum 2% risk per trade with confidence adjustments
- **Portfolio Heat Limits**: Prevents overexposure across all positions
- **Concentration Risk**: Limits exposure to individual tickers
- **Confidence Multipliers**: Larger positions for higher confidence signals

## Configuration

### Default Configuration
```typescript
{
  confidenceBasedExits: {
    highConfidence: {
      profitTarget: 0.75,    // 75% profit target
      stopLoss: 0.40,        // 40% stop loss
      timeDecayThreshold: 0.25 // 25% time decay threshold
    },
    mediumConfidence: {
      profitTarget: 0.50,    // 50% profit target
      stopLoss: 0.50,        // 50% stop loss
      timeDecayThreshold: 0.30 // 30% time decay threshold
    },
    lowConfidence: {
      profitTarget: 0.30,    // 30% profit target
      stopLoss: 0.60,        // 60% stop loss
      timeDecayThreshold: 0.35 // 35% time decay threshold
    }
  },
  timeBasedExits: {
    maxHoldingPeriodHours: 72,
    expirationWarningDays: 2,
    forceExitBeforeExpirationHours: 4,
    weekendExitEnabled: false
  },
  portfolioHeatManagement: {
    maxPortfolioHeat: 0.20,           // 20% maximum heat
    heatReductionThreshold: 0.15,     // Start reducing at 15%
    emergencyExitThreshold: 0.25,     // Emergency exit at 25%
    consecutiveLossLimit: 3,          // Max 3 consecutive losses
    drawdownProtectionThreshold: 0.05 // 5% drawdown protection
  },
  positionSizing: {
    maxRiskPerTrade: 0.02,    // 2% maximum risk per trade
    maxPositionSize: 0.10,    // 10% maximum position size
    minPositionSize: 0.001,   // 0.1% minimum position size
    confidenceMultipliers: {
      high: 1.2,    // 20% larger for high confidence
      medium: 1.0,  // Normal size for medium confidence
      low: 0.8      // 20% smaller for low confidence
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration Presets
- **DEFAULT**: Balanced approach for most trading styles
- **CONSERVATIVE**: Lower risk, tighter controls, earlier exits
- **AGGRESSIVE**: Higher risk, looser controls, longer holding periods

## Usage

### Basic Integration
```typescript
import { AutomatedPositionManager } from './AutomatedPositionManager';
import { DEFAULT_POSITION_MANAGEMENT_CONFIG } from './AutomatedPositionManagerConfig';

// Initialize with default configuration
const automatedManager = new AutomatedPositionManager(
  DEFAULT_POSITION_MANAGEMENT_CONFIG,
  exitConditionManager,
  riskManager,
  databaseManager,
  eventBus
);

// Start automation
await automatedManager.startAutomation();
```

### Position Size Validation
```typescript
const validation = await automatedManager.validatePositionSize(
  signal,
  proposedSize,
  accountBalance
);

if (!validation.approved) {
  console.log(`Position size adjusted: ${validation.adjustmentReason}`);
  positionSize = validation.recommendedSize;
}
```

### Portfolio Heat Monitoring
```typescript
const heatMetrics = automatedManager.getPortfolioHeatMetrics();
console.log(`Current heat: ${(heatMetrics.currentHeat * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
console.log(`Available capacity: ${(heatMetrics.availableCapacity * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
```

### Configuration Updates
```typescript
// Update configuration at runtime
automatedManager.updateConfig({
  portfolioHeatManagement: {
    maxPortfolioHeat: 0.15 // Reduce from 20% to 15%
  }
});
```

## Event System

The system emits and listens to various events for integration:

### Emitted Events
- `exit:signal`: Automated exit triggered
- `paper:position:expired`: Position expired and settled
- `paper:service:degraded`: Service degradation detected
- `paper:alert:triggered`: Risk alert triggered

### Listened Events
- `paper:trade:executed`: New position created
- `paper:position:update`: Position price/PnL updated
- `paper:position:closed`: Position closed
- `paper:account:update`: Account balance updated
- `market:data`: Market data update received

## Risk Management Features

### Portfolio Heat Management
1. **Heat Calculation**: Based on absolute P&L exposure across all positions
2. **Graduated Response**:
   - 15% heat: Start reducing positions
   - 20% heat: Maximum normal operation
   - 25% heat: Emergency exit all positions
3. **Consecutive Loss Protection**: Reduce position sizes after 3 consecutive losses
4. **Drawdown Protection**: Defensive mode at 5% account drawdown

### Time-Based Risk Controls
1. **Maximum Holding Period**: Prevent indefinite position holding
2. **Expiration Management**: Avoid assignment risk through early exits
3. **Weekend Risk**: Optional position closure before weekends
4. **Theta Decay Monitoring**: Exit positions with excessive time decay

### Position Sizing Controls
1. **Risk Per Trade**: Maximum 2% account risk per position
2. **Portfolio Concentration**: Prevent overexposure to single tickers
3. **Confidence Scaling**: Larger positions for higher confidence signals
4. **Minimum/Maximum Limits**: Prevent extremely small or large positions
